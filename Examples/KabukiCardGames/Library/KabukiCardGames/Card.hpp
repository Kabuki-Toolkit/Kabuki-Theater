/*< Class that represents a card in a card game.
    Cards as we know them originated in Europe. We traditionally think of cards as only being clubs, hearts, diamonds, and spades, but there are also
    some other variations from other European countries. For more information on them, please Wiki "Playing Card Suits". The nifty thing about these extra
    card decks, is that we can make a double deck of cards, and use the suit culture to tell the decks apart.
